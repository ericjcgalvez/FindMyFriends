Title: Microbial Comparative Genomics in R
Version: 0.3.0

Author: Thomas Lin Pedersen
Maintainer: Thomas Lin Pedersen <thomasp85@gmail.com>
Description: A framework for doing microbial comparative genomics in R. The main
    purpose of the package is assisting in the creation of pangenome matrices where
    genes from related organisms are grouped by similarity, as well as the analysis
    of these data. FindMyFriends provides many novel approaches to doing pangenome
    analysis and supports a gene grouping algorithm that scales linearly, thus
    making the creation of huge pangenomes feasible.
