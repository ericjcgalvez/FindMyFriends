\title{Get gene-to-genegroup relationship}
\usage{
seqToGeneGroup(object)

\S4method{seqToGeneGroup}{pgInMem}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A pgVirtual subclass}
}
\value{
An integer vector with an element for each gene in the pangenome.
}
\description{
This method returns the group membership for each gene in the pangenome as
a vector of indices. Element 1 corresponds to gene 1 and the value is the
index of the corresponding gene group. If gene groups have yet to be defined
it returns a vector of length 0.
